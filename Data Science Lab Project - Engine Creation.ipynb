The route, rated a maximum difficulty of 5/5, featured the infamous Colle delle Finestre—this year’s Cima Coppi—with its punishing 9.2% average gradient and gravel-packed final 9km. The weather added to the challenge, starting with light veils of cloud and 24°C in Verrès but finishing with drizzle and a biting 20°C in Sestrière, where crosswinds gusted at 20 km/h.  \n","\n","Christopher Harper of Team Jayco Alula emerged victorious, conquering the Finestre and the final climb to claim the stage win in 5:27:29.

Harper’s triumph was sealed on the Finestre, where he dominated the KOM points, earning 50 for the climb and securing an additional nine on the final ascent. His efforts also propelled him into the top six of the Maglia Azzurra standings, now led by Lorenzo Fortunato (Xds Astana Team) with 353 points.  \n","\n","The general classification saw a major shakeup.
