Starting in Lucca, riders circle nearly all of the city walls, then head through the southern part of town with a series of turns. After the first time check, the course becomes straight with a slight uphill drag toward the Monti Pisani tunnel (950 m). After the tunnel, fast sweeping bends take the riders to San Giuliano Terme and Asciano, then into Pisa about 3 km from the line. The finish is right beside the Leaning Tower. Several curves and river crossings. Just after 1 km to go, the route leaves the riverfront for the city centre. At 500 m, riders hit cobblestones that continue until the last corner. The final straight is 200 m on 6-metre-wide asphalt.\n","Weather Conditions at start:\n"," Temperature in Celsius: 20°\n"," Conditions (data in italian translate in english if used in the article): molto nuvoloso\n"," Precipitations (in mm): 0.0\n"," Wind Speed (in Km/h): 11\n"," Wind Direction: SSE\n","Weather Conditions at finish:\n"," Temperature in Celsius: 19°\n"," Conditions (data in italian translate in english if used in the article): rovesci di pioggia\n"," Precipitations (in mm): 4.0\n"," Wind Speed (in Km/h): 7\n"," Wind Direction: NE\n","Number of Riders that finished the race: 171\n","Order of Arrival, top 15:\n"," Position: 1, Rider: Daan Hoole, Team: Lidl-Trek, Time: 32:30, Gap to leader: 0:00\n"," Position: 2, Rider: Joshua Tarling, Team: Ineos Grenadiers, Time: 32:37, Gap to leader: 0:07\n"," Position: 3, Rider: Ethan Hayter, Team: Soudal Quick-Step, Time: 32:40, Gap to leader: 0:10\n"," Position: 4, Rider: Mattia Cattaneo, Team: Soudal Quick-Step, Time: 32:53, Gap to leader: 0:23\n"," Position: 5, Rider: Edoardo Affini, Team: Team Visma -

Joshua Tarling of Ineos Grenadiers came in seven seconds behind, while Ethan Hayter of Soudal Quick-Step completed the podium with a solid third-place performance.\\nSoudal Quick-Step further showed their strength in the discipline, placing two riders in the top four with Mattia Cattaneo finishing fourth. Edoardo Affini of Team Visma - Lease A Bike also delivered a commendable performance, taking fifth place, just one second off Cattaneo.\\nRiders like Jay Vine, Lucas Plapp and Marco Frigo filled out the top ten, all managing to stay within a minute of Hoole’s time.\\nThe time trial triggered significant shifts in the general classification. Isaac Del Toro of UAE Team Emirates Xrg managed to retain the maglia rosa, despite pressure from teammate Juan Ayuso, who now sits just 25 seconds behind in second.\\nAntonio Tiberi of Bahrain Victorious moved into third, while Simon Yates and Primož Roglič climbed to fourth and fifth respectively, tightening the battle for the overall lead. Richard Carapaz dropped from fourth to ninth, losing precious seconds in a discipline not naturally suited to him.\\nIn the mountains classification, Lorenzo Fortunato of Xds Astana Team comfortably held onto the maglia azzurra with 96 points, well ahead of Ayuso and Paul Double. The flat profile of the day meant no change at the top, but the standings remain closely packed below Fortunato.\\nThe points classification saw no surprises either, with Mads Pedersen of Lidl-Trek keeping the maglia ciclamino thanks to his consistent sprint finishes earlier in the race. Alessandro Tonelli and Olav Kooij remain his closest challengers, though still far from threatening his lead.\\nWith 171 riders completing the stage, the Giro now heads into its second half, and the race for all three jerseys has begun to sharpen. Stage 10, despite lacking the mountain drama or mass sprints, proved how decisive a well-placed time trial can be, both for specialists like Hoole and for general classification contenders navigating the fine balance between risk and conservation.\""],"metadata":{"id":"Y_W87XAoy9Tj"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Writing Titles"],"metadata":{"id":"XIdK7v2_ymm3"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Stage_10_Titles = {}"],"metadata":{"id":"6mr8OEcPyt1J"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Stage_10_Titles['DeepSeek'] = title_creator(HF_Token, Stage_10_Articles['DeepSeek'], model = 'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324')"],"metadata":{"id":"V9TR2ciEy0QU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Stage_10_Titles['Llama'] = title_creator(HF_Token, Stage_10_Articles['Llama'], model = 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct-fp8')"],"metadata":{"id":"eTPF1ctA0rUv"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Stage_10_Titles['Qwen'] = title_creator(HF_Token, Stage_10_Articles['Qwen'], model = 'qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b')"],"metadata":{"id":"oGVmsf2q0ul6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Stage_10_Titles['ChatGPT'] = \"Daan Hoole Shines in Rain-Soaked Pisa Time Trial as GC Battle Tightens\""],"metadata":{"id":"0uwhrcEc00sN"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Stage 20 Articles"],"metadata":{"id":"WN2Ny53ci9A9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Data Formatting"],"metadata":{"id":"LkTaTMQQr3wz"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data = {\n","    \"General\": [Stage_20_Info, Stage_20_Weather, Stage_20_Order_of_arrival],\n","    \"Maglia Rosa Standing\": [Stage_20_Maglia_Rosa],\n","    \"King of the Mountains\": [Stage_20_Maglia_Azzurra, Stage_20_KOM_Corio_km_69, Stage_20_KOM_Colle_del_Lys_km_115, Stage_20_KOM_Colle_delle_Finestre_km_177, Stage_20_KOM_Sestrière_km_205],\n","    \"Intermediate Sprints\": [Stage_20_Maglia_Ciclamino, Stage_20_Intermediate_Sprint_Rocca_Canavese_km_64, Stage_20_Intermediate_Sprint_Chiusa_di_San_Michele_km_137, Stage_20_Points_Stage_Standing],\n","    \"Official Withdrawals\": [Stage_20_official_withdrawals],\n","    \"Previous Standings\": [Stage_19_Maglia_Rosa, Stage_19_Maglia_Azzurra, Stage_19_Maglia_Ciclamino]\n","}"],"metadata":{"id":"zKQlnWt5nxHp"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Printing the query for LLMs"],"metadata":{"id":"rZbMLI2fsEyX"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(request_builder(data,\"20th Stage of Giro d'Italia\",competition_code = 'G', approx_length = 500, additional_requests=None))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Elv1x4CWkUgD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750668112523,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":55,"user":{"displayName":"Giovanni Noè","userId":"07995439497930346085"}},"outputId":"d4d893a3-6c6e-44da-fbc9-865dea99e63e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["You are a sports journalist, write an article about the cycling competition '20th Stage of Giro d'Italia of about 500 words'.

The 205-kilometer route from Verrès to Sestrière, with an imposing 4500 meters of elevation gain, tested the riders to their limits and crowned a deserving solo winner in Christopher Harper of Team Jayco Alula.\\nThe day began under warm skies with light veils of cloud covering the Canavese region. As the peloton rolled out at 24 degrees and minimal wind, the early terrain remained flat before the brutal climbing began. The riders first tackled the Colle del Lys after Viù, before descending into Susa for the stage’s defining moment—the ascent of Colle delle Finestre, this year’s Cima Coppi. Known for its gravel sections and relentless gradients, the Finestre did not disappoint. With a sustained average of 9.2% and pitches of up to 14% through Meana di Susa, it became the springboard for decisive attacks.\\nChristopher Harper emerged strongest on the high mountain passes, claiming maximum points on the Finestre and later leading over the final climb to Sestrière. His dominant performance netted him 59 King of the Mountains points and sealed a remarkable solo stage victory in 5:27:29. Harper crossed the line in light drizzle and 20-degree temperatures, nearly two minutes ahead of Alessandro Verre of Arkea-B&B Hotels, with Simon Yates finishing third.\\nYates's ride had deeper implications beyond the podium. The Briton’s consistent climbing and final effort to limit losses allowed him to overturn the general classification. Starting the day in third, he vaulted ahead of Isaac Del Toro and Richard Carapaz to take the maglia rosa with an accumulated time of 79:18:42. Del Toro now trails by 3 minutes and 56 seconds, while Carapaz sits 47 seconds further back.\\nThe final podium of the stage saw young Italian Gianmarco Garofoli finish fourth, while riders like Rémy Rochas, Martin Marcellusi, and Carlos Verona filled out the top ten, all more than four minutes behind Harper.\\nThe King of the Mountains jersey remains firmly on the shoulders of Lorenzo Fortunato, who didn’t score today but maintains a commanding lead with 353 points. Harper’s climb to sixth in that classification reflects his stellar day in the high Alps.\\nIn the points competition, Mads Pedersen of Lidl-Trek continues to lead convincingly with 277 points, though Wout Van Aert’s aggressive riding netted him additional points on climbs, pushing him closer to second place Olav Kooij.\\nWith no official withdrawals and 159 riders finishing what may be remembered as the queen stage of this year’s Giro, the focus now shifts to the final day. But for now, all eyes are on Christopher Harper’s heroic solo victory and Simon Yates’s stunning ascent into pink.\""],"metadata":{"id":"E0nPBH_9xthy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Writing Titles"],"metadata":{"id":"jKBv_oK72eCI"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Stage_20_Titles = {}"],"metadata":{"id":"tVFS9-bc2iuB"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Stage_20_Titles['DeepSeek'] = title_creator(HF_Token, Stage_20_Articles['DeepSeek'], model = 'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324')"],"metadata":{"id":"g7USMld42k_C"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Stage_20_Titles['Llama'] = title_creator(HF_Token, Stage_20_Articles['Llama'], model = 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct-fp8')"],"metadata":{"id":"-ZEGD76x2oaS"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Stage_20_Titles['Qwen'] = title_creator(HF_Token, Stage_20_Articles['Qwen'], model = 'qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b')"],"metadata":{"id":"hXy3dnFO2rve"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Stage_20_Titles['ChatGPT']= \"Harper Conquers Finestre as Yates Seizes Pink in Giro’s Queen Stage\""],"metadata":{"id":"AIiIGljP2vE-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Gran Piemonte Articles"],"metadata":{"id":"CK94A0fesY0P"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Data Formatting"],"metadata":{"id":"CDkDqojjGGUF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data = {\n","    \"General\": [Gran_Piemonte_Info, Gran_Piemonte_Weather, Gran_Piemonte_Order_of_arrival]\n","    }"],"metadata":{"id":"QKUS05NNvh8r"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Printing the query for LLMs"],"metadata":{"id":"cRuWV-4vGYQn"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(request_builder(data,\"Gran Piemonte\",competition_code = None, approx_length = 500, additional_requests=None))"],"metadata":{"id":"WzvGGkraGcy3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750668243925,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":37,"user":{"displayName":"Giovanni Noè","userId":"07995439497930346085"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"1074d835-b11d-4b4c-9bb6-1ff8ea191530"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Competition code not specified or recognised, the article will be generic\n","You are a sports journalist, write an article about the cycling competition 'Gran Piemonte of about 500 words'.

Starting from Valdengo, the peloton embarked on a 182-kilometer journey to Borgomanero, traversing a route that remained largely flat in the first half before giving way to a series of hills and demanding climbs in the second.\\nThe race began under grey skies and light rain, with temperatures around 21°C and light winds brushing the riders as they passed through the lowlands near Biella and Candelo. These early kilometers offered fast, flat terrain, weaving between rice fields and riverbanks. However, once the race entered the hillier terrain near Varallo, the true battle began. The riders faced a series of climbs including the Passo della Colma, followed by the ascents of Cremosina and Traversagna, which served to stretch out the peloton and set the stage for a decisive finale.\\nThe final 11-kilometer circuit around Borgomanero, tackled after a first pass over the finish line, was particularly tricky. With rain intensifying to 19 mm and temperatures dropping to 15°C, the riders had to contend with slippery roads, tight turns, and a false-flat finish. Despite these conditions, the race culminated in a high-paced finale with a large group sprinting for the line.\\nIt was Neilson Powless of EF Education - EasyPost who emerged victorious, timing his effort to perfection and crossing the line in 3 hours, 57 minutes, and 36 seconds. The American’s performance showcased both his climbing ability and tactical intelligence, especially in handling the difficult final kilometers.\\nJust seven seconds behind came Corbin Strong of Israel - Premier Tech, narrowly edging out Movistar’s Alexander Aranburu for second place. Both riders were part of a tightly packed lead group that finished with identical times, reflecting how finely balanced the contest remained until the final meters.\\nFilippo Magli delivered an impressive fourth place for VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizanè, confirming his growing stature in the peloton. Xandro Meurisse, Tobias Halland Johannessen, and Natnael Tesfazion also featured prominently, all finishing within the same time gap, underscoring the intensity of the closing stages.\\nWith 155 riders completing the race, this edition of Gran Piemonte reinforced its reputation as a tactical and unpredictable event. The shifting terrain, coupled with challenging weather, made for a compelling spectacle. While the flat early kilometers provided little drama, the climbs and technical finale ensured that only the most adaptable and resilient riders could compete for victory. Powless’s win marks a significant moment in his season, as he adds a prestigious one-day race to his growing list of achievements.\""],"metadata":{"id":"UYn2LRvUNTBV"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Writing Titles"],"metadata":{"id":"SFr-jkGR3r4r"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Gran_Piemonte_Titles = {}"],"metadata":{"id":"PzTvjGtj3v7Q"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Gran_Piemonte_Titles['DeepSeek'] = title_creator(HF_Token, Gran_Piemonte_Articles['DeepSeek'], model = 'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324')"],"metadata":{"id":"PphEK3tx3y1D"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Gran_Piemonte_Titles['Llama'] = title_creator(HF_Token, Gran_Piemonte_Articles['Llama'], model = 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct-fp8')"],"metadata":{"id":"nrwvickR31d-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Gran_Piemonte_Titles['Qwen'] = title_creator(HF_Token, Gran_Piemonte_Articles['Qwen'], model = 'qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b')"],"metadata":{"id":"08p5PY_k34pA"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Gran_Piemonte_Titles['ChatGPT'] = \"Neilson Powless Claims Rain-Soaked Victory at Gran Piemonte After Tactical Finale\""],"metadata":{"id":"AzVC9rWs365K"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# First Model Selection"],"metadata":{"id":"gckMNIbP9y7v"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Printing Articles for Reading"],"metadata":{"id":"Lxgg3p7Z9RB6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Stage 10"],"metadata":{"id":"F8fsgYNj9ZkN"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print('DeepSeek Stage 10:\\n')\n","print(Stage_10_Titles['DeepSeek'])\n","print(Stage_10_Articles['DeepSeek'])\n","\n","print('\\n\\n\\nLlama Stage 10:\\n')\n","print(Stage_10_Titles['Llama'])\n","print(Stage_10_Articles['Llama'])\n","\n","print('\\n\\n\\nQwen Stage 10:\\n')\n","print(Stage_10_Titles['Qwen'])\n","print(Stage_10_Articles['Qwen'])\n","\n","print('\\n\\n\\nChatGPT Stage 10:\\n')\n","print(Stage_10_Titles['ChatGPT'])\n","print(Stage_10_Articles['ChatGPT'])"],"metadata":{"id":"sG7Jz1eU9XgI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750668348135,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":36,"user":{"displayName":"Giovanni Noè","userId":"07995439497930346085"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"3edb6ab0-8ad4-41d9-ea38-658f51dcfb0b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["DeepSeek Stage 10:\n","\n","Daan Hoole Wins Thrilling Giro d’Italia Time Trial as Del Toro Retains Maglia Rosa\n","The 10th stage of the Giro d’Italia delivered a thrilling individual time trial from Lucca to Pisa, covering 28.6 kilometers of mostly flat terrain with a short climb and a technical finish beside the iconic Leaning Tower.

The weather started dry but ended with rain, affecting the latter part of the race. Daan Hoole won the stage, with Tarling and Hayter following. Isaac Del Toro kept the Maglia Rosa, and there were some shifts in the general classification, like Simon Yates moving up. The King of the Mountains and points classifications are mentioned, but the main focus seems to be on the time trial's impact on the overall standings.\n","\n","The title should capture the essence of the stage. Since it's a time trial, maybe mention that. Highlighting the stage winner and the GC leader retaining the jersey. Also, the rain and technical course played a role.

But maybe the user expects a title in the form of a headline, not a full paragraph. But in the initial problem, the user provided an article and then the example output was that first sentence.

The user wants only the body of the article without any formatting, so I should avoid headers or sections. Let me start by understanding the data.\n","\n","The stage is a time trial from Lucca to Pisa, 28.6 km with 150m elevation. It's mostly flat but has a short climb mid-route. Technical details include circling Lucca's walls, a tunnel, fast bends, and cobblestones near the finish. Weather started cloudy with no rain but ended with rain and lower temps.\n","\n","Top finishers: Daan Hoole won, followed by Joshua Tarling and Ethan Hayter. The Maglia Rosa (leader) is Isaac Del Toro, maintaining his position. I should note the standings changes, but since the previous Maglia Rosa top 10 didn't have many changes, maybe focus on the time gaps. Derek Gee moved up to 12th in the general classification.\n","\n","For the King of the Mountains (Maglia Azzurra), Lorenzo Fortunato leads, followed by Juan Ayuso. Points classification (Maglia Ciclamino) is led by Mads Pedersen. No withdrawals, so that's not needed.\n","\n","I need to structure the article to highlight the time trial's challenges, the stage winner, and how the GC standings shifted. Mention the weather's impact, especially the rain at the end. Also, note the cobblestones near the finish and the route's technical aspects. Since the user wants only relevant data, I should focus on top 15 in each category and their changes from previous standings.\n","\n","Check if any of the top GC riders improved their positions. For example, Simon Yates moved from 6th to 4th. Primož Roglič is 5th. Derek Gee moved into 12th. In the mountains, Lorenzo Fortunato is still leading, and in points, Mads Pedersen remains first.\n","\n","Make sure to mention the unique aspects of the course: the start near Lucca's walls, the tunnel, cobblestones, and the finish near the Leaning Tower. The weather started dry but ended rainy, which might have affected the riders' performances, especially in the latter part of the race.\n","\n","I should start with the stage result, then move to GC standings, then the other classifications. Avoid invented data, stick strictly to what's provided. Use quotes or vivid descriptions to make it engaging, but since it's factual, focus on the facts. Maybe highlight how the time trial was a test for the GC contenders and how the rain could have impacted their times. Also, note that the cobblestones might have been tricky for bike handling.\n","\n","Check the word count. Make sure it's around 500 words. Avoid mentioning any retirements since there are none. Focus on the top 15 in each category and the variations. For example, in the Maglia Rosa, Juan Ayuso is still second, Antonio Tiberi third. Simon Yates moved up, and Roglič is fifth. In the points, the top remains the same with Pedersen leading.\n","\n","Also, note that this was a time trial, so individual efforts are key. Mention the top finishers and their teams, the time gaps. Maybe note that Hoole's win was by 7 seconds over Tarling. The technical finish might have allowed some riders to gain time, but since it's a TT, the time gaps might be small.\n","\n","I think that's all.

With its mix of technical turns, a short climb, and a cobblestone finale near Pisa’s iconic Leaning Tower, the course demanded both tactical focus and raw speed. The rain that arrived midway through the stage added a chaotic twist, challenging riders to adapt to slick conditions on the narrow, winding descent toward the finish.  \n","\n","Dutchman Daan Hoole (Lidl-Trek) emerged victorious, clocking 32:30 to secure his maiden Grand Tour stage win. His blistering effort edged out Britain’s Joshua Tarling (INEOS Grenadiers) by seven seconds, with Ethan Hayter (Soudal Quick-Step) completing the podium in third. The victory marked Hoole’s first career Giro stage and highlighted his growing reputation as a time-triallist capable of thriving under pressure. Tarling’s second-place finish, meanwhile, cemented his status as a rising star, while Hayter’s consistent performance underscored his team’s strength in the discipline.  \n","\n","The stage’s technical demands and late rain proved pivotal for the overall standings. Isaac Del Toro (UAE Team Emirates XRG) retained the Maglia Rosa, extending his lead to 34:11:37 after finishing 12th in the stage.

Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) remained third, 38 seconds back, while Simon Yates (Team Visma-Lease a Bike) surged to fourth, overtaking Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) and Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) in the general classification. Primož Roglič (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), despite finishing fifth on the stage, climbed to fifth overall, signaling his intent to challenge as the race enters its mountainous second half.  \n","\n","The rain-soaked finale also played a role in reshuffling the peloton. Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech), who finished 14th on the stage, moved up to 12th in the GC, while young talent Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates XRG) dropped to sixth, 1:40 behind Del Toro. The stage’s 150m of elevation, concentrated in a brief drag toward the Monti Pisani tunnel, offered little respite for the riders, with the final cobblestone stretch testing bike-handling skills in treacherous conditions.  \n","\n","In the supporting classifications, Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS Astana Team) extended his lead in the Maglia Azzurra (King of the Mountains) with 96 points, maintaining a commanding advantage over Juan Ayuso (50 points) and Paul Double (36 points).

Starting in Verrès under clear skies and mild temperatures, the race quickly transitioned from a flat opening in the Canavese region to a series of punishing ascents in the Valli di Lanzo. The stage’s centerpiece, the Colle delle Finestre, crowned this year’s Cima Coppi, proved to be the ultimate battleground, its final 9 kilometers of gravel roads and gradients peaking at 14% shattering the peloton. The stage concluded with a steady climb to Sestrière, where Christopher Harper (Team Jayco Alula) soloed to victory, outpacing Alessandro Verre (Arkea-B&B Hotels) by 1 minute and 49 seconds. Simon Yates (Team Visma - Lease A Bike), finishing third, secured the Maglia Rosa, seizing the overall lead from Isaac Del Toro in a dramatic reshuffling of the general classification.  \n","\n","The route’s unforgiving profile left little room for error. After the early breakaway, the peloton fractured on the Colle del Lys, setting the stage for Yates’ calculated assault on the Finestre. The gravel section, notorious for its instability, saw riders battling both the terrain and gusting winds, with temperatures plummeting from 24°C at the start to 20°C amid drizzle at the summit. Harper, who claimed maximum points on the Finestre, surged ahead on the final climb to Sestrière, his 5:27:29 finish time underscoring his dominance. Verre, despite losing the stage, bolstered his King of the Mountains ambitions, while Yates’ consistency vaulted him to the top of the GC standings, displacing Del Toro by nearly four minutes.  \n","\n","The Maglia Rosa shakeup saw Del Toro drop to second (79:22:38) and Richard Carapaz (Ef Education - Easypost) move up to third (79:23:25), with Derek Gee and Damiano Caruso maintaining proximity. In the KOM classification, Lorenzo Fortunato (Xds Astana Team) retained his lead with 353 points, though Harper’s 50-point haul on the Finestre (3rd overall) narrowed the gap. Manuele Tarozzi (Vf Group Bardianicsf-Faizane’) bolstered his chances with early climb victories, but Fortunato’s consistency kept him firmly in control.  \n","\n","Points classification leader Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) extended his Maglia Ciclamino advantage despite finishing 10th overall, with Wout Van Aert (Team Visma - Lease A Bike) and Dries De Bondt (Decathlon Ag2R La Mondiale Team) collecting crucial sprint points on the Finestre’s steepest ramps. However, Pedersen’s 277-point total remains unchallenged, aided by his team’s strategic support.  \n","\n","With 159 riders reaching Sestrière, the stage underscored the Giro’s physical toll and tactical depth. Harper’s maiden stage win, Yates’ GC resurgence, and the looming final climbs in the Alps set the stage for a thrilling conclusion, as Fortunato, Pedersen, and their rivals vie for secondary jerseys amid the race’s dwindling days. The 20th stage, a masterclass in climbing adversity, proved once again that the Giro’s legacy is forged in its mountains.\n","\n","\n","\n","ChatGPT Stage 20:\n","\n","Harper Conquers Finestre as Yates Seizes Pink in Giro’s Queen Stage\n","The 20th stage of the Giro d’Italia delivered exactly what fans expected from the final mountain showdown of the race: high altitude drama, tactical battles, and a reshuffling of the general classification. The 205-kilometer route from Verrès to Sestrière, with an imposing 4500 meters of elevation gain, tested the riders to their limits and crowned a deserving solo winner in Christopher Harper of Team Jayco Alula.\n","The day began under warm skies with light veils of cloud covering the Canavese region. As the peloton rolled out at 24 degrees and minimal wind, the early terrain remained flat before the brutal climbing began. The riders first tackled the Colle del Lys after Viù, before descending into Susa for the stage’s defining moment—the ascent of Colle delle Finestre, this year’s Cima Coppi. Known for its gravel sections and relentless gradients, the Finestre did not disappoint. With a sustained average of 9.2% and pitches of up to 14% through Meana di Susa, it became the springboard for decisive attacks.\n","Christopher Harper emerged strongest on the high mountain passes, claiming maximum points on the Finestre and later leading over the final climb to Sestrière. His dominant performance netted him 59 King of the Mountains points and sealed a remarkable solo stage victory in 5:27:29. Harper crossed the line in light drizzle and 20-degree temperatures, nearly two minutes ahead of Alessandro Verre of Arkea-B&B Hotels, with Simon Yates finishing third.\n","Yates's ride had deeper implications beyond the podium. The Briton’s consistent climbing and final effort to limit losses allowed him to overturn the general classification. Starting the day in third, he vaulted ahead of Isaac Del Toro and Richard Carapaz to take the maglia rosa with an accumulated time of 79:18:42. Del Toro now trails by 3 minutes and 56 seconds, while Carapaz sits 47 seconds further back.\n","The final podium of the stage saw young Italian Gianmarco Garofoli finish fourth, while riders like Rémy Rochas, Martin Marcellusi, and Carlos Verona filled out the top ten, all more than four minutes behind Harper.\n","The King of the Mountains jersey remains firmly on the shoulders of Lorenzo Fortunato, who didn’t score today but maintains a commanding lead with 353 points. Harper’s climb to sixth in that classification reflects his stellar day in the high Alps.\n","In the points competition, Mads Pedersen of Lidl-Trek continues to lead convincingly with 277 points, though Wout Van Aert’s aggressive riding netted him additional points on climbs, pushing him closer to second place Olav Kooij.\n","With no official withdrawals and 159 riders finishing what may be remembered as the queen stage of this year’s Giro, the focus now shifts to the final day. But for now, all eyes are on Christopher Harper’s heroic solo victory and Simon Yates’s stunning ascent into pink.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Gran Piemonte"],"metadata":{"id":"RuVuGQQ29gVS"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print('DeepSeek Gran Piemonte:\\n')\n","print(Gran_Piemonte_Titles['DeepSeek'])\n","print(Gran_Piemonte_Articles['DeepSeek'])\n","\n","print('\\n\\n\\nLlama Gran Piemonte:\\n')\n","print(Gran_Piemonte_Titles['Llama'])\n","print(Gran_Piemonte_Articles['Llama'])\n","\n","print('\\n\\n\\nQwen Gran Piemonte:\\n')\n","print(Gran_Piemonte_Titles['Qwen'])\n","print(Gran_Piemonte_Articles['Qwen'])\n","\n","print('\\n\\n\\nChatGPT Gran Piemonte:\\n')\n","print(Gran_Piemonte_Titles['ChatGPT'])\n","print(Gran_Piemonte_Articles['ChatGPT'])"],"metadata":{"id":"scyPcZkm9jMY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750668348198,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":31,"user":{"displayName":"Giovanni Noè","userId":"07995439497930346085"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"e3cdcfba-cabc-4022-dadb-69492ffc7c5b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["DeepSeek Gran Piemonte:\n","\n","\"Powless Triumphs in Rain-Soaked Gran Piemonte After Thrilling Solo Breakaway\"\n","The Gran Piemonte unfolded over a challenging 182-kilometer route from Valdengo to Borgomanero, testing riders with a mix of flat stretches and demanding climbs.

Xandro Meurisse, Tobias Halland Johannessen, and Natnael Tesfazion also featured prominently, all finishing within the same time gap, underscoring the intensity of the closing stages.\n","With 155 riders completing the race, this edition of Gran Piemonte reinforced its reputation as a tactical and unpredictable event. The shifting terrain, coupled with challenging weather, made for a compelling spectacle. While the flat early kilometers provided little drama, the climbs and technical finale ensured that only the most adaptable and resilient riders could compete for victory. Powless’s win marks a significant moment in his season, as he adds a prestigious one-day race to his growing list of achievements.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Testing different lengths"],"metadata":{"id":"8zn8SjmQ-BDT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Writing 200 Words Articles"],"metadata":{"id":"W0aL19YZ-jUf"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data = {\n","    \"General\": [Stage_20_Info, Stage_20_Weather, Stage_20_Order_of_arrival],\n","    \"Maglia Rosa Standing\": [Stage_20_Maglia_Rosa],\n","    \"King of the Mountains\": [Stage_20_Maglia_Azzurra, Stage_20_KOM_Corio_km_69, Stage_20_KOM_Colle_del_Lys_km_115, Stage_20_KOM_Colle_delle_Finestre_km_177, Stage_20_KOM_Sestrière_km_205],\n","    \"Intermediate Sprints\": [Stage_20_Maglia_Ciclamino, Stage_20_Intermediate_Sprint_Rocca_Canavese_km_64, Stage_20_Intermediate_Sprint_Chiusa_di_San_Michele_km_137, Stage_20_Points_Stage_Standing],\n","    \"Official Withdrawals\": [Stage_20_official_withdrawals],\n","    \"Previous Standings\": [Stage_19_Maglia_Rosa, Stage_19_Maglia_Azzurra, Stage_19_Maglia_Ciclamino]\n","}"],"metadata":{"id":"sA0pg4s3-ITa"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(request_builder(data,\"20th Stage of Giro d'Italia\",competition_code = 'G', approx_length = 200, additional_requests=None))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"jegHsHNwywnc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750668348242,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":44,"user":{"displayName":"Giovanni Noè","userId":"07995439497930346085"}},"outputId":"99795eee-fa76-434f-9e98-a21cd36ef1e2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["You are a sports journalist, write an article about the cycling competition '20th Stage of Giro d'Italia of about 200 words'.

This year’s race unfolded over a challenging 182-kilometre route from Valdengo to Borgomanero, offering a nuanced blend of flat and hilly terrain that kept riders and spectators guessing until the final sprint. What began under a steady drizzle in the plains of Piedmont evolved into a tactical and grueling battle through the region’s undulating roads, culminating in a triumphant solo finish.\\nThe early kilometers of the race, stretching beyond 100 kilometres, were largely flat. Riders navigated lowland roads threading through Biella, Candelo and the rice fields flanking the river Sesia. The peloton stayed compact during this initial stretch, conserving energy and jostling for position ahead of the more decisive terrain. The calm, however, was short-lived.\\nAs the race approached Varallo, the profile shifted dramatically. The climbs of Passo della Colma, Cremosina and Traversagna served as a launchpad for attacks and a natural selection process within the peloton. Though none of these ascents are individually devastating, their cumulative effect, combined with the rain that persisted throughout the day, sapped the strength of many and reshuffled the race dynamics.\\nConditions played no small role in shaping the outcome. The race began in Valdengo under light rain, with temperatures around 21 degrees Celsius. By the time the leaders reached Borgomanero, the weather had deteriorated significantly. The temperature dropped to 15 degrees, and precipitation had intensified, reaching 19 millimetres. The slick roads and persistent rainfall demanded caution, especially in the closing circuit—an 11-kilometre lap featuring rolling roads punctuated with roundabouts, traffic islands, and other urban furniture that added an extra layer of tension.\\nYet in spite of these challenges, Neilson Powless of EF Education–EasyPost seized the moment with authority. With a perfectly timed move in the final kilometres, the American broke free from a tightly packed group and powered through the slick roads to claim victory in 3 hours, 57 minutes and 36 seconds. It was a signature performance from Powless, who combined tactical intelligence with sheer physical resilience to outwit his rivals in the final stretch.\\nBehind him, a large group of contenders crossed the line just seven seconds later. Corbin Strong of Israel–Premier Tech and Alexander Aranburu of Movistar rounded out the podium, both clocking in at 3:57:43. The race's narrow time gaps, particularly from second to fifteenth place—all within the same time—underscored the fierce competition and how closely matched the top contenders were on the day.\\nFilippo Magli impressed with a strong fourth-place finish for VF Group–Bardiani CSF–Faizanè, further highlighting the emergence of younger Italian talent. Not far behind was Xandro Meurisse of Alpecin-Deceuninck and Tobias Halland Johannessen from Uno-X Mobility, both delivering performances that spoke to their consistency and positioning through the hilly second half of the race.\\nThe presence of riders like Matej Mohorič and Thomas Pidcock in the top fifteen hinted at the race's high calibre, even though neither managed to dictate terms on the final circuit. Francesco Busatto, Edoardo Zambanini, and Lorenzo Rota also finished strongly, representing the tactical depth and unpredictability that make one-day races like Gran Piemonte so engaging.\\nIn total, 155 riders reached the finish line, a testament to the peloton's resilience amid tough weather and terrain. The hills, though not extreme in elevation, offered enough variety and rhythm to splinter the field and challenge the riders' legs after a long season.\\nGran Piemonte’s 2025 edition will be remembered not only for Neilson Powless’s intelligent and powerful win but also for the way the route and weather combined to create a dramatic and nuanced contest. From the flat rice fields of the Sesia valley to the rolling finish in Borgomanero, the race was a reminder of how much depth and complexity can exist within a single-day event. It demanded patience, power, and precision—and rewarded those who could master all three.\""],"metadata":{"id":"dAlQ3ImAzsiJ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Words_800_titles = {}"],"metadata":{"id":"CegmYC0c6Eqm"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Words_800_titles['Llama'] = title_creator(HF_Token, Words_800_articles['Llama'], model = 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct-fp8')"],"metadata":{"id":"u0sBOslC6HOE"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Words_800_titles['ChatGPT'] = \"Neilson Powless Triumphs in Rain-Soaked Gran Piemonte with Tactical Solo Attack\""],"metadata":{"id":"M1BwXUX56JGI"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Additional Tests"],"metadata":{"id":"jtvBM-JB_LhG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Writing Technical Articles"],"metadata":{"id":"9ek1wSIRJoQE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data = {\n","    \"General\": [Stage_20_Info, Stage_20_Weather, Stage_20_Order_of_arrival],\n","    \"Maglia Rosa Standing\": [Stage_20_Maglia_Rosa],\n","    \"King of the Mountains\": [Stage_20_Maglia_Azzurra, Stage_20_KOM_Corio_km_69, Stage_20_KOM_Colle_del_Lys_km_115, Stage_20_KOM_Colle_delle_Finestre_km_177, Stage_20_KOM_Sestrière_km_205],\n","    \"Intermediate Sprints\": [Stage_20_Maglia_Ciclamino, Stage_20_Intermediate_Sprint_Rocca_Canavese_km_64, Stage_20_Intermediate_Sprint_Chiusa_di_San_Michele_km_137, Stage_20_Points_Stage_Standing],\n","    \"Official Withdrawals\": [Stage_20_official_withdrawals],\n","    \"Previous Standings\": [Stage_19_Maglia_Rosa, Stage_19_Maglia_Azzurra, Stage_19_Maglia_Ciclamino]\n","}"],"metadata":{"id":"D4NkotwqFooc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(request_builder(data,\"20th Stage of Giro d'Italia\",competition_code = 'G', approx_length = 500, additional_requests=\"THE FOLLOWING REQUESTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT STICK ON THEM: write the article with a serious and technical tone, it is for a cycling specific journal\"))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"nG2PL86fJ7in","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750680951247,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":53,"user":{"displayName":"Giovanni Noè","userId":"07995439497930346085"}},"outputId":"8de159e3-2382-47c3-d626-32b70f9fe9b4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["You are a sports journalist, write an article about the cycling competition '20th Stage of Giro d'Italia of about 500 words'.

Covering 205 kilometers from Verrès to Sestrière, the riders faced the toughest profile of this year’s race: five out of five in difficulty, 4500 meters of altitude gain, and a sequence of climbs that tested every aspect of climbing and descending skill.\\nThe day began under mild conditions, with light cloud cover and a temperature of 24 degrees in Verrès. The peloton rolled calmly through the flat opening stretch towards Canavese before the terrain tilted upward. After the village of Viù, the first major ascent began: the Colle del Lys. The climb served as a warm-up to what would become a decisive section of the race—the fearsome Colle delle Finestre, this year’s Cima Coppi.\\nThe Finestre delivered all the spectacle its reputation promised. With an average gradient of 9.2 percent and a brutal ramp of 14 percent near Meana di Susa, the climb’s final 9 kilometers on gravel and 45 hairpins made it the centerpiece of the stage. It was here that Christopher Harper of Team Jayco Alula made his move. Already among the most active on the climb, Harper pushed clear over the summit and flew down the technical descent to Pian dell’Alpe.\\nWhile rain and a sharp drop in temperature welcomed the riders into Sestrière—20 degrees with light drizzle and a strong eastern wind—Harper remained unshaken. He managed the final steady climb on the SS23 with resilience and poise, soloing to an impressive win in 5:27:29. It was a performance of power and precision, further sweetened by the 59 points he collected across the final two categorized climbs, placing him sixth in the Maglia Azzurra standings.\\nBehind him, Alessandro Verre of Arkea-B&B Hotels claimed second, 1:49 back, while Simon Yates of Team Visma - Lease A Bike took third at 1:57. Crucially, that third-place finish and consistent performance over the climbs allowed Yates to leapfrog both Isaac Del Toro and Richard Carapaz to seize the Maglia Rosa. With a total time of 79:18:42, he now leads Del Toro by nearly four minutes.\\nThe top of the GC has changed dramatically. Del Toro dropped to second, Carapaz to third, and Derek Gee and Damiano Caruso round out the top five. The fight for pink is far from over, but Yates now holds the cards heading into the final stage.\\nIn the King of the Mountains classification, Lorenzo Fortunato remains in control with 353 points, comfortably ahead of his Astana teammate Christian Scaroni. The points classification also holds steady, with Mads Pedersen of Lidl-Trek leading at 277 points.\\nThe day saw no withdrawals, but it was not without casualties in spirit. Only 159 riders made it to the finish in a stage that spared no one.

This year’s race unfolded over a challenging 182-kilometre route from Valdengo to Borgomanero, offering a nuanced blend of flat and hilly terrain that kept riders and spectators guessing until the final sprint. What began under a steady drizzle in the plains of Piedmont evolved into a tactical and grueling battle through the region’s undulating roads, culminating in a triumphant solo finish.\n","The early kilometers of the race, stretching beyond 100 kilometres, were largely flat. Riders navigated lowland roads threading through Biella, Candelo and the rice fields flanking the river Sesia. The peloton stayed compact during this initial stretch, conserving energy and jostling for position ahead of the more decisive terrain. The calm, however, was short-lived.\n","As the race approached Varallo, the profile shifted dramatically. The climbs of Passo della Colma, Cremosina and Traversagna served as a launchpad for attacks and a natural selection process within the peloton. Though none of these ascents are individually devastating, their cumulative effect, combined with the rain that persisted throughout the day, sapped the strength of many and reshuffled the race dynamics.\n","Conditions played no small role in shaping the outcome. The race began in Valdengo under light rain, with temperatures around 21 degrees Celsius. By the time the leaders reached Borgomanero, the weather had deteriorated significantly. The temperature dropped to 15 degrees, and precipitation had intensified, reaching 19 millimetres. The slick roads and persistent rainfall demanded caution, especially in the closing circuit—an 11-kilometre lap featuring rolling roads punctuated with roundabouts, traffic islands, and other urban furniture that added an extra layer of tension.\n","Yet in spite of these challenges, Neilson Powless of EF Education–EasyPost seized the moment with authority. With a perfectly timed move in the final kilometres, the American broke free from a tightly packed group and powered through the slick roads to claim victory in 3 hours, 57 minutes and 36 seconds. It was a signature performance from Powless, who combined tactical intelligence with sheer physical resilience to outwit his rivals in the final stretch.\n","Behind him, a large group of contenders crossed the line just seven seconds later. Corbin Strong of Israel–Premier Tech and Alexander Aranburu of Movistar rounded out the podium, both clocking in at 3:57:43. The race's narrow time gaps, particularly from second to fifteenth place—all within the same time—underscored the fierce competition and how closely matched the top contenders were on the day.\n","Filippo Magli impressed with a strong fourth-place finish for VF Group–Bardiani CSF–Faizanè, further highlighting the emergence of younger Italian talent. Not far behind was Xandro Meurisse of Alpecin-Deceuninck and Tobias Halland Johannessen from Uno-X Mobility, both delivering performances that spoke to their consistency and positioning through the hilly second half of the race.\n","The presence of riders like Matej Mohorič and Thomas Pidcock in the top fifteen hinted at the race's high calibre, even though neither managed to dictate terms on the final circuit. Francesco Busatto, Edoardo Zambanini, and Lorenzo Rota also finished strongly, representing the tactical depth and unpredictability that make one-day races like Gran Piemonte so engaging.\n","In total, 155 riders reached the finish line, a testament to the peloton's resilience amid tough weather and terrain. The hills, though not extreme in elevation, offered enough variety and rhythm to splinter the field and challenge the riders' legs after a long season.\n","Gran Piemonte’s 2025 edition will be remembered not only for Neilson Powless’s intelligent and powerful win but also for the way the route and weather combined to create a dramatic and nuanced contest. From the flat rice fields of the Sesia valley to the rolling finish in Borgomanero, the race was a reminder of how much depth and complexity can exist within a single-day event. It demanded patience, power, and precision—and rewarded those who could master all three.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"_o2jUBhp_Nta"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Cycling Journal Articles"],"metadata":{"id":"Ap5ZoDZPPEIY"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print('Llama Cycling Journal:\\n')\n","print(Cycling_Journal_Titles['Llama'])\n","print(Cycling_Journal_Articles['Llama'])\n","\n","print('\\n\\n\\nChatGPT Cycling Journal:\\n')\n","print(Cycling_Journal_Titles['ChatGPT'])\n","print(Cycling_Journal_Articles['ChatGPT'])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"pcL6sYFqPIeo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750681157122,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":24,"user":{"displayName":"Giovanni Noè","userId":"07995439497930346085"}},"outputId":"24301af3-f877-49f0-9183-35b507edb845"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Llama Cycling Journal:\n","\n","Giro d'Italia Stage 20: Harper takes victory as Yates claims Maglia Rosa\n","The 20th stage of the Giro d'Italia was a grueling mountain stage that saw riders tackle a 205km course with an altitude gain of 4500m, featuring several tough climbs including the Cima Coppi, Colle delle Finestre.

The final climb to Sestrière, while not as steep as some of the earlier ascents, still proved demanding, with riders needing to maintain a high pace to secure a top placing.\n","\n","\n","\n","ChatGPT Cycling Journal:\n","\n","Harper Conquers Colle delle Finestre as Yates Takes Pink Jersey in Giro d’Italia Stage 20\n","Stage 20 of the Giro d’Italia delivered a brutal mountain test with a dramatic reshuffling at the top of the general classification and a commanding solo victory. Covering 205 kilometers from Verrès to Sestrière, the riders faced the toughest profile of this year’s race: five out of five in difficulty, 4500 meters of altitude gain, and a sequence of climbs that tested every aspect of climbing and descending skill.\n","The day began under mild conditions, with light cloud cover and a temperature of 24 degrees in Verrès. The peloton rolled calmly through the flat opening stretch towards Canavese before the terrain tilted upward. After the village of Viù, the first major ascent began: the Colle del Lys. The climb served as a warm-up to what would become a decisive section of the race—the fearsome Colle delle Finestre, this year’s Cima Coppi.\n","The Finestre delivered all the spectacle its reputation promised. With an average gradient of 9.2 percent and a brutal ramp of 14 percent near Meana di Susa, the climb’s final 9 kilometers on gravel and 45 hairpins made it the centerpiece of the stage. It was here that Christopher Harper of Team Jayco Alula made his move. Already among the most active on the climb, Harper pushed clear over the summit and flew down the technical descent to Pian dell’Alpe.\n","While rain and a sharp drop in temperature welcomed the riders into Sestrière—20 degrees with light drizzle and a strong eastern wind—Harper remained unshaken. He managed the final steady climb on the SS23 with resilience and poise, soloing to an impressive win in 5:27:29. It was a performance of power and precision, further sweetened by the 59 points he collected across the final two categorized climbs, placing him sixth in the Maglia Azzurra standings.\n","Behind him, Alessandro Verre of Arkea-B&B Hotels claimed second, 1:49 back, while Simon Yates of Team Visma - Lease A Bike took third at 1:57. Crucially, that third-place finish and consistent performance over the climbs allowed Yates to leapfrog both Isaac Del Toro and Richard Carapaz to seize the Maglia Rosa. With a total time of 79:18:42, he now leads Del Toro by nearly four minutes.\n","The top of the GC has changed dramatically. Del Toro dropped to second, Carapaz to third, and Derek Gee and Damiano Caruso round out the top five. The fight for pink is far from over, but Yates now holds the cards heading into the final stage.\n","In the King of the Mountains classification, Lorenzo Fortunato remains in control with 353 points, comfortably ahead of his Astana teammate Christian Scaroni. The points classification also holds steady, with Mads Pedersen of Lidl-Trek leading at 277 points.\n","The day saw no withdrawals, but it was not without casualties in spirit. Only 159 riders made it to the finish in a stage that spared no one. Stage 20 was a true queen stage—relentless, unpredictable, and unforgettable.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Kids Article"],"metadata":{"id":"5Jq03YmXPJ0b"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print('Llama Kids:\\n')\n","print(Kids_Journal_Titles['Llama'])\n","print(Kids_Journal_Articles['Llama'])\n","\n","print('\\n\\n\\nChatGPT Kids:\\n')\n","print(Kids_Journal_Titles['ChatGPT'])\n","print(Kids_Journal_Articles['ChatGPT'])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"v_y8rwjmPMGK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750674712331,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":58,"user":{"displayName":"Giovanni Noè","userId":"07995439497930346085"}},"outputId":"c29d7979-52e8-49b2-e20d-b7b712c1b3bc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Llama Kids:\n","\n","Neilson Powless Wins Gran Piemonte Cycling Competition\n","The Gran Piemonte cycling competition was an exciting event that took the riders on a thrilling ride through the rolling hills and scenic landscapes of Italy.
